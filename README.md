A reference application for .NET developers looking to learn more about using [Apache Cassandra][cassandra] and
[DataStax Enterprise][dse] in their applications and services. Learn more at [killrvideo.github.io][killrvideo].

## Pull Requests, Requests for More Examples
This project will continue to evolve along with Cassandra and you can expect that as Cassandra and the DataStax driver add new features, this sample application will try and provide examples of those.  I'll gladly accept any pull requests for bug fixes, new features, etc.  and if you have a request for an example that you don't see in the code currently, send me a message [@LukeTillman][twitter] on Twitter or open an issue here on GitHub.
